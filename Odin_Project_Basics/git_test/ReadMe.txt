small note of clarification. I already had a Learning repository before
taking part in the odin project course. So instead of creating a new 
repository I decided to just add a new folder to it called 
"Odin_Project_Basics". I will be adding the files and folders of the git_test
repo to this folder following the command line commands presented in the 
lesson.
